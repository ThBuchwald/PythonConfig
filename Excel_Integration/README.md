# Create Excel files from Python

The (`xlsxwriter`)[https://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.io/index.html] module gives you the ability to write into the MS Excel `.xlsx` format. There is a great documentation on how to integrate this behaviour with `pandas`. The notebook shows an excerpt from the documentation; view the HTML [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ThBuchwald/PythonConfig/blob/master/Excel_Integration/ExcelIntegration.html) and the notebook [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ThBuchwald/PythonConfig/blob/master/Excel_Integration/ExcelIntegration.ipynb).

Excel files can be *read* by using the `XLRD` package.
